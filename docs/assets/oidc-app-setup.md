### Running the Samples with your Okta Organization
These steps require an Okta account - if you do not have one, sign up for a free [Developer Edition Organization](https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/).

1. Create a new **Web** application by selecting **Create New Application** from the *Applications* page.
2. After accepting the default configuration, select **Create Application** to redirect back to the *General Settings* of your application.
3. Finally, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, as it will be needed for the client configuration.
